I'm gonna be using the fundamentals from the last few lessons (different data types: strings, numbers, etc.; functions) to create a rock paper scissors game
in which you'll be playing against the computer, not another human player.
This is not my first time programming. I've already done some projects with C# in Unity. 
However this was about a year ago and I got almost no exercise in this time and also forgot a lot of things.
I don't think it'll be particulary hard but lets see.

>>Update after finishing the project:

Finished the game right now and the whole thing took forever. Not because it was very hard but because I took multiple breaks between. That doesn't mean that it was easy though. I have been struggling for a few hours and didn't know what the problem in my code was. After a week long break I thought that I could try again and saw the solution instantly.
